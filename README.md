# Insurance Claims Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project explores an insurance claims dataset to identify customer and policy characteristics associated with higher claim costs. The analysis focuses on understanding risk drivers and segmenting policies by claim severity to support decision-making in insurance contexts.

## Business Question
Which customer, policy, and incident characteristics are associated with higher insurance claim costs, and how can this information support risk segmentation?

## Dataset
- Source: Public insurance claims dataset (Kaggle)
- Each row represents an insurance claim or policy record
- Key outcomes include total claim amount and claim components (injury, property, vehicle)

## Approach
- Initial data inspection and quality assessment
- Data cleaning driven by business reasoning
- Exploratory analysis of claim frequency and severity
- Identification of high-risk segments and cost drivers

## Key Insights
- To be completed after analysis

## Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Notes
This project is exploratory and intended to demonstrate analytical thinking rather than production-ready modelling.
